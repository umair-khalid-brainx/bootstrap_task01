                <h4 class="fw-bold">What Is Collagen Protein?</h4>
            
                <p>By now, youve probably seen the ads and heard people talking about collagen proteinâits everywhere. But whats all
                    the
                    buzz about? Is it time for you to jump on the bandwagon? And if youve already joined the masses, why should you
                    make
                    the switch to Ageless Multi-Collagen Protein Powder?</p>
            
                <p>In order to answer these questions, we first have to answer this one: What is <strong>collagen ?</strong></p>
            
                <p>Simply put, collagen is the most abundant and arguably the most important protein in the body. In fact, collagen
                    constitutes a whopping 30% of the protein in your body. Aside from water, collagen is the most plentiful
                    substance in
                    your bodyâpretty crazy, right?</p>
            
                <p>For example, collagen makes up 70% of the protein in our skin, and its one of the primary structural proteins in
                    joints, bones, cartilage, ligaments, tendons, hair, fingernails, the intestinal wall, and more. Collagen is the
                    glueâliterally, it comes from the Greek word for glueâthat supports, connects, and holds everything together.
                </p>
            
                <p>Not surprisingly, healthy levels of collagen are vital to support:</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Smooth, healthy, young-looking skin</li>
                    <li>Strong, healthy fingernails and glossy hair</li>
                    <li>Healthy, supple joints</li>
                    <li>Bone health</li>
                    <li>Healthy digestion and gut health</li>
                    <li>Strong, healthy tendons and ligaments</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>Theres moreâincluding healthy, flexible blood vessels and organ healthâbut the moral of the story is that
                    collagen is a
                    component of your entire body, and it has a tremendous impact on how you look and feel.</p>
            
                <h4 class="fw-bold">Why Do You Need a Collagen Powder?</h4>
            
                <p>When youre young, your body makes all the collagen it needs. Thats why your skin is firm and glowing, your joints
                    are
                    supple, and your digestive system works like a champ.</p>
            
                <p>So, what happens as you get older? Your body loses its ability to make collagen, and to make matters worse,
                    collagen
                    might reduce more rapidly thanks to things like smoking, stress, excess sun exposure, physical activity, and
                    diet. For
                    example, consuming sugar, refined carbs, and poor-quality fats (such as industrial produced vegetable oils),
                    which are
                    common in processed foods, can all contribute to collagen depletion.</p>
            
                <p class="fw-bold">In simple terms, we produce less collagen with age.</p>
            
                <p>For example, studies show that skin levels of collagen decrease by about 11 to 13% with each passing decade after
                    the age
                    of 20, and by the time folks hit their 80s, collagen levels may be, on average, only one-third of what they were
                    in
                    their 20s.</p>
            :not(i)
                <img src="assets/graph.jpg" alt="Graph" class="graph">
            
                <p>Over time, this reduction in collagen may contribute toâ¦</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Skin sags and wrinkles</li>
                    <li>Hair gets thinner, and nails lose their strength</li>
                    <li>Joints become stiff and less flexible</li>
                    <li>Recovery from activities like exercise slows</li>
                    <li>Occasional gut-related complaints come out of nowhere</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>That may sound grim, but its not all bad news. In fact, theres GREAT news. <strong>You can ramp up your bodys
                        collagen
                        production by consuming more collagen protein in your diet.</strong></p>
            
                <p>Collagen protein is very different from other common protein sourcesâsuch as beef, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy,
                    and
                    plantsâbecause it features a unique profile of amino acids, and it is especially rich in glycine, proline, and
                    hydroxyproline, which is found ONLY in collagen protein. Together, these three amino acids account for 40 to 50%
                    of the
                    amino acids in collagen protein, which is 10 to 20 times higher than other common protein sources.</p>
            
                <p>Why is that important? These are the raw materials the body needs to support collagen production and support
                    healthy
                    levels of collagen. Even more, research shows that consuming a very specific type of collagen proteinâknown as
                    collagen
                    peptidesâtrigger the body to make more collagen and produce more hyaluronic acid, which is a lubricating fluid
                    thats a
                    key component of healthy, hydrated skin and healthy, supple joints.</p>
            
                <p class="fw-bold">So, where can you find collagen protein?</class="fw-bold">
            
                <p>Well, just like us, collagen is the primary structural protein in animals. Youll find it in their connective
                    tissue,
                    including skin, bones, and cartilage. Unfortunately, weve all but abandoned the traditional ânose to tailâ way
                    of
                    eating.</p>
            
                <p>Most of us eat boneless, skinless muscle meat, which provides protein thats quite a bit different than collagen
                    protein, which has a very specific combination of amino acids and functional properties. We rarely eat bone-in
                    meat, let
                    alone the skin, organ meats, and other connective tissue from land and sea creatures.</p>
            
                <p>And while bone broth can be a great source of collagen protein, making homemade bone broth takes time to make and
                    clean
                    upâa lot of time. The good news is that you can buy pre-made bone broth thats pretty darn tasty. However, that
                    can
                    become an expensive habit quite quickly, and lets face it, most people arent interested in sipping a cup of bone
                    broth
                    every single day, which youd need to do to continuously support healthy levels of collagen.</p>
            
                <h5 class="fw-bold">The Problem with Most Collagen Supplements on the Market</h5>
            
                <p>Thankfully, theres a better, simpler solution that makes it even easier to get more collagen in your diet: You
                    can use
                    a collagen powder. <strong>Unfortunately, not all collagen powders are created equal.</strong></p>
            
                <p>For starters, many collagen protein powders come from a single source, such as chicken or cattle. This is
                    important
                    because different sources of collagen (e.g., chicken, beef) feature different types of collagen. While at least
                    28
                    different types of collagen have been identified, the three most common are types I, II, and III, which account
                    for 80 to
                    90% of the collagen in the body.</p>
            
                <p>Now, these various types of collagen are important because they serve different functions in the body. For
                    example,
                    collagen types I and III, which come from cattle and fish, are found in our skin, bones, and tendons. Type II
                    collagen,
                    which comes from chicken, is almost exclusively present in the cartilage between bones.</p>
            
                <p>Even though it can be confusing, try not to get too caught up in the Roman numeral soup. The point here is that
                    different types (and sources) of collagen may contribute to different benefits in the body, which is why we
                    think its
                    optimal to consume multiple collagen types from multiple sources .</p>
            
                <p>In addition to that major problem, here are some of the other drawbacks of the ingredients in some other collagen
                    powders, including some bone broth and gelatin supplements:</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>They are not broken down into smaller collagen peptides,</strong> also known as collagen hydrolysate
                        or hydrolyzed collagen,
                        which are bioactive collagen building blocks that are more easily and readily absorbed (than whole collagen
                        protein)</li>
                    <li><strong>They are missing one of the essential amino acids.</strong> Collagen protein is missing the
                        essential amino acid tryptophan.</li>
                    <li><strong>They taste and/or smell</strong> which limits how you can use them and can ruin the taste of
                        whatever you mix them in.</li>
                    <li><strong>They dont dissolve well in cold or room temperature liquids,</strong> often leaving a sticky, clumpy
                        mess at the bottom of your
                        glass thats unpleasant to drink.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>Fortunately, that all changes now, and were excited to introduce you to your collagen powder solution: Its called
                    <strong>BioTRUST Ageless Multi-Collagen Protein.</strong>
                </p>
            
                <h5 class="fw-bold">Why BioTRUST Ageless Multi-Collagen Protein Powder Is The Right Choice</h5>
            
                <p>To provide support for an array of full-body benefits, Ageless Multi-Collagen contains FIVE key collagen types
                    (I, II,
                    III, V, and X) from FOUR different food sources:</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Hydrolyzed collagen peptides from grass-fed, pasture-raised cattle (types I and III)</li>
                    <li>Hydrolyzed collagen peptides from sustainable fish (type I)</li>
                    <li>A unique and patented eggshell membrane (types I, V, and X)</li>
                    <li>Type II collagen from chicken</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>While collagen types I, II, and III are mission critical, type V works hand-in-hand with types I and III to
                    promote
                    healthy skin, and type X is a type of collagen that is especially important to promote healthy bones.Footnoteâ 
                    Altogether, we truly believe this combination of five types of collagen is particularly important to reap all
                    the
                    benefits collagen supplements offer.</p>
            
                <p>Simply put, we combined these five different types of collagen - instead of just one or two types - to provide
                    support
                    for an array of full-body benefits</p>
            
                <p>Of course, <strong>Ageless Multi-Collagen Protein contains collagen protein that is naturally hydrolyzed and
                        features BioActive
                        Collagen Peptides.</strong> These are absorbed intact and trigger the body to make collagen.Footnoteâ  Not
                    only that, collagen
                    peptides stimulate the bodys production of hyaluronic acid, which is a lubricating fluid thats a key component
                    of
                    healthy, hydrated skin and healthy, supple joints</p>
            
                <p>Recent scientific research has revealed several exciting health benefits of supplementation with collagen
                    peptides,
                    which have been shown to support:</p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Healthy, firm, young-looking skin</li>
                    <li>Strong, healthy fingernails</li>
                    <li>Healthy, mobile joints</li>
                    <li>Healthy bones</li>
                    <li>Healthy, strong tendons and ligaments</li>
                    <li>Healthy Looking Hair</li>
                    <li>Recovery from physical activity</li>
                    <li>Healthy body composition when combined with regular exercise</li>
                    <li>Gut health</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>As an added bonus, Ageless Multi-Collagen Protein also contains tryptophan, an amino acid that is typically
                    missing from
                    collagen protein.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Ageless Multi-Collagen Protein comes in a unflavored version that is odorless and tasteless, as well as
                        delicious
                        flavors, like vanilla, chocolate, and fruit punch. No matter what flavor, Ageless Multi-Collagen dissolves
                        quickly and
                        easily in both hot and cool liquids.</strong> Thats right, Ageless Multi-Collagen Protein was formulated to
